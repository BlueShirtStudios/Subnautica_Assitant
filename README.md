<h1>ALT, Your PDA with an opinion</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
ALT is an AI assitant to help you with your playthrough of subnautica and subnautica below zero. ALT has everything, from helping you locate materials to participating in a debate about the local wild life.

This project has 2 major phases:
<ul>
    <li>Commandline Assitant</li>
    <li>Web Integraded </li>
</ul>

The reason this is started at the cmdline is that I am unfamilier with web UI designing and specilise in backend designing. After ALT is completly built, I will develop an web UI and integrate this existing backend with it. But this a boring reason for looking at a terminal UI, so go read <a href="#backstory">ALT's Story</a> for a more entertaining reason.

<h2>Features(Implemented and to come...)</h2>
<ul>
    <li>RAG Support</li>
    <li>Async System</li>
    <li>Decision-Based AI</li>
    <li>Custom Tool Utilization</li>
    <li>Strong Knowledge Base</li>
    <li>Build Knowledge According to Custom Criteria</li>
    <li>Chat History Access</li>
</ul>

This list will be exstended as development progress and I discover another cool thing to add. I aim to create a modular AI that I can use in future projects, subnautica was just the topic that came to mind when I thought of this idea

<h2>Current Focus</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Make current code more modular</li>
    <li>Chat History feautures should work should work as intened</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="backstory">ALT's Story</h2>
ALT is your PDA's advanced version, but Alterra only implemented it as a failover in drastic situations. And for our scenario, out PDA got eaten by a sandshark while making more databank entries. This leaves you with no choice but to fabricate an old computer that can run the emergency failover assitant. Your eyes meet with a black screen only providing the option to ask questions, no fancy UI, no greeting, just the option to ask a question or exit. Will this be able to adjust to the old technology or are you going to forsake knowledge for convience?


I will further update the Readme file as development progresses.
