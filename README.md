<h1 align="center">🧠 ALT — Your PDA with an Opinion</h1>

---

## 🧾 Description

**ALT** is an intelligent AI assistant designed to help you on your *Subnautica* and *Below Zero* adventures.  
From locating materials to debating the local wildlife, **ALT** has a lot to say — and sometimes, it even makes sense. 😉

This project is being developed in **two major phases**:

<ul>
  <li><b>Phase 1:</b> Command-Line Assistant 🖥️</li>
  <li><b>Phase 2:</b> Web-Integrated Version 🌐</li>
</ul>

Why start in the terminal?  
Because I specialize in **backend development** and wanted to focus on building ALT’s “brain” before giving it a shiny interface.  
But if you’d rather hear a *cooler* reason, check out <a href="#backstory">ALT’s Story</a> below.

## ⚙️ Features (Implemented & Planned)

<ul>
  <li>🧩 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Support</li>
  <li>⚡ Asynchronous System</li>
  <li>🧠 Decision-Based AI Logic</li>
  <li>🛠️ Custom Tool Utilization</li>
  <li>📚 Strong Knowledge Base</li>
  <li>🎯 Build Knowledge Using Custom Criteria</li>
  <li>💬 Persistent Chat History Access</li>
  <li>💭 Opinion Mode — ALT shares its thoughts on situations, items, or wildlife</li>
</ul>

This list will expand as development continues and I discover new features worth adding.  
My long-term goal is to make **ALT** a *modular AI framework* I can reuse across future projects — Subnautica just happens to be the perfect testbed for now.

## 🔧 Current Focus

<ul>
  <li>Refactoring core systems for better modularity 🧱</li>
  <li>Ensuring chat history features work as intended 🗃️</li>
</ul>

## 📖 ALT’s Story <a id="backstory"></a>

> “Your PDA is gone. The sandshark didn’t like you scanning it.”

ALT is the advanced version of the standard PDA AI — but Alterra only activated it during *critical failures*.  
After your PDA is devoured while cataloging new data entries, you’re left with no choice but to **fabricate an old terminal** capable of running the **emergency failover assistant**.  

When you boot it up, you’re met with nothing but a black screen — no sleek UI, no friendly voice, just a blinking cursor and one prompt:  
> *Ask a question... or exit.*

Can this outdated AI adapt to primitive tech?  
Or will you abandon knowledge for convenience?  
The choice... is yours.

## 🧭 Development Notes

This README will be updated as development progresses. Stay tuned for new features, story expansions, and UI previews.
