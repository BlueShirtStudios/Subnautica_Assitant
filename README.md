This is a subautica inspired app to provide help during your playthrough of the game. It will include feautures such as creature information, fragment location, material locations and more features will be added as the development progresses

The creature information will be able to give you all needed information about a creature, examples will be:
-> Biome
-> Danger Level
-> An image
-> Depth Found At

I will further update the Readme file as development progresses.
