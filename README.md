This will assist you to get to know your envoriment which you are exploring or want to explore, enlighting you on what to expect in this game. Search and filter are addedd that you can search by a creature name, filter creatures accroding to biome or depth level.

An AI assistant is present, it will provide you with short, detailed answer if you wish to get an answer quickly.
